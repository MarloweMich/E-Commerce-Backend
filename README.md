# E-Commerce_Backend


  ##Description
  
  - Information in Database for a store is able to be manipulated (created, updated, views, and destroyed) regarding specific products, the categories that those products fall under and the tags or keywords that are associated with those products. Easily manageable properties on all products such as price and stock are included.
  
  ##Usage
  
  - To initialize the application, run "npm i" to install all dependencies listed in the package.json. Then enter the MySQL shell and run the "source db/schema.sql" to create the database and tables. After exiting the MySQL shell (\q), run "node seeds/index.js" to seed the database with all relevant data and then run "npm start" to start managing the inventory.
